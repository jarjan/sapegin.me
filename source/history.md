## Pre-computer Life

I don’t remember much about my life before I met computers, but it wouldn’t be very interesting anyway. I remember my parents wanted to teach me (without success) to draw. And how I pulled a goose by its neck in a zoo but it didn’t get through the grating. But… I heard this story later on.

## First Computer

I got my first computer from my uncle as a gift. It was Soviet clone of the legendary [ZX Spectrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum) in orange case. With the computer I got cassettes with games, a tape player and a book about computer internals and introduction to Basic (which was embedded in the Spectrum) in two volumes. 

Every game tooks about five minutes to load and they were boring as all games are, so I gave up shortly and started to type some code from the book and tried to change it.

## QuickBasic

I got my first experience in real, sane programming at Children’s Creative Center at Polyanka. Experience I gained using the Spectrum found much use there: while other pupils scratched their heads trying to draw a [flowchart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart) I was finishing my program on the computer.

There weren’t enough computers for all pupils so we worked in pairs. In the end of the year we had to make a game. I worked with my neighbour and best friend Ivan. Programming wasn’t his passion but he drew very well, and due to our common love of metal music, blood and skeletons we were an awesome team. Unfortunately [game](http://museum.sapegin.ru/gpf/group/history/ironman.html) wasn’t finished.

## First Steps in Web Development

My first introduction to HTML and web development began with articles in Russian “Submarine” magazine. Using that articles and without an internet connection at home I made my [first personal homepage](http://museum.sapegin.ru/tsott/).

<x-embed id="tsott" title="The animation on the splash page of my first homepage looked like this.">

It was the beginning of the biggest passion in my life that became my work few years later. PHP, my own CMSs, a lot of free hosting providers, many versions of the homepage and thousands of lines of hodgie code.

Meanwhile I entered the Moscow State College of Information Technology where I learned touch typing and Microsoft Office. My classmate and I started there another Project of the Century (indeed not finished) — [a game](http://museum.sapegin.ru/lotr/) based on “The Lord of the Rings” book.

## First Job

Studying in the college became a work there as a computer class manager, teacher and web developer. I had almost my own office on the balcony of computer class (I shared it with a guy who fixed hardware but he worked on a different schedule) and I started to make the college’s new website. Unfortunately necessity to scold students and to look after class distracted me from the coding.

## Photography

When I started to earn my very own money I wanted to learn photography. Eventually it became [my second big passion](http://morning.photos/).

## Front-end

After a year of working at SEO oriented web design studio I suddenly changed PHP and back-end to JavaSript and front-end.

## Dogs

At one point it became quite boring to code alone and now I [get a lot of help](http://instagram.com/p/XF6KXahtmS/) from The Most Beautiful [Dessi the Dachshund](http://morning.photos/albums/dachshund/) and since 2011 from [Tsiri the Saluki](http://morning.photos/albums/saluki/) (but she’s a beginner coder yet).
